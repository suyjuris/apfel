    // Note on spline rendering: This is the mathematically most involved part of the
    // program. Basically, the problem is finding the t s.t. the corresponding point on the spline
    // (p0, p1, p2) is closest to p. The technique I use is based on [1, section 4.4], although I
    // have made some significant adjustments to generally simplify the formula and put as much work
    // as possible into the vertex shader. See also the references in [1].
    //  I will not derive the detailed formulae here, but just give a rough overview on how it works
    // and what steps one has to do to end up at my solution.    
    //  Solving the problem exactly requires you to solve third-degree polynomials, which uses cubic
    // roots and all sorts of nastiness. Instead, we proceed by inversion, taking a formula that
    // yields t exactly for a point p _on the curve_. However, the formula is continuous everywhere,
    // and we can get a good enough approximation to t as long as we are close to the curve. For
    // rendering thin lines that is all we need, as points farther away are not drawn anyway.
    //    
    //  The basic steps are as follows:
    //     1. Take a function f that has f(x) = 0 iff x is on the curve
    //     2. Do a first-order approximation of f based on p: f1(x) := f(p) + Df(p)x
    //     3. The set f1 = 0 forms a line
    //     4. Find the closest point to p on that line, p' := p - f(p) Df(p) / dot(Df(p), Df(p))
    //        (D is the total derivative, or, in this case, the transposed gradient.)
    //     5. Apply the inversion formula to p' to get t
    //
    // Regarding f: Look at the paper to get the precise definition, but basically
    //     f(x) = b(x) d(x) + a(x)**2
    // with a, b, d being affine functions mapping into the real numbers.
    //  The inversion formula in step 5 is also in the paper, but it ends up being much simpler in
    // my version, so I will not give the general form here.
    //
    //  Mainly, I did one thing to simplify the problem: Solve it for the spline ((0,0), (1/2,0),
    // (0,1)) (which I will call 'base spline' in the following) by hand and then do a linear
    // transformation to apply that result to the general case. f becomes the function
    //     f(x,y) = y - (x+y)**2
    // and
    //     Df(x,y) = (-2(x+y), 1-2(x+y))
    // Let h be the function mapping t to the position of the point on the curve, i.e.
    //     h(t) = (t(1-t), t**2)
    // It is not difficult to see that, for any point (x,y) on the curve, x+y = t. As a matter of
    // fact, the inversion formula in the paper reduces to precisely this.
    //
    //  Great, so we now know how to solve the problem for the base spline. To map any general
    // spline, first apply a translation to get p0 = 0 (this does not affect any calculations, so
    // just assume this was already the case). Then, choose a matrix A s.t. A p1 = (1/2, 0) and A p2
    // = (0, 1). Let fA be the function f for the base spline, and fG the general one from above, for
    // the spline we are interested in.) Conveniently,
    //     det(A)**2 fA(A x) = fG(x)
    // (This holds due to the special structure of a, b and d.) To get p', the constant does not
    // matter. Additionally, it follows that
    //     DfG(x) = det(A)**2 DfA(A x) A 
    // Finally, to get t we calculate A p' via
    //     A p' = A p - A fA(A p) (DfA(A x) A) / dot(DfA(A x) A, DfA(A x) A)
    // and sum its coordinates.
    //     t = (1 1) A p'
    //       = (1 1) A p - (1 1) A fA(A p) (DfA(A x) A) / dot(DfA(A x) A, DfA(A x) A)
    //       = (1 1) A p - fA(A p) ((1 1) A (DfA(A x) A)) / dot(DfA(A x) A, DfA(A x) A)
    // Letting
    //     (x,y) := A p
    //     z := x + y
    //     dg := transpose(DfA(A x) A) = transpose(A) (-2z, 1-2z)
    //     w := (1 1) A dg
    // the above term becomes
    //       = (x+y) - (y - (x+y)**2) ((1 1) A dg) / dot(dg, dg)
    //       = z - (y - z**2) w / dot(dg, dg)
    // Note that all the constants I introduced are linear functions of p and can thus be calculated
    // in the vertex shader and then linearly interpolated. So the last line really is the only
    // thing the fragment shader has to do to get t.
    //
    //  One small wrinkle of this technique (also present in the original version): If p0, p1, p2 are
    // colinear, things are not well-defined. As a small exercise, you may want to look at the
    // description above and find out where exactly things break down, as it is a bit implicit. I'll
    // wait.
    //  Back again? Great. As you no doubt noticed, the A is not well-defined in that case. Fixing
    // the problem is easy, however, it suffices to add a small perturbation to p1 so that the
    // points are not colinear anymore. (Also, move it to the middle of p0, p2 beforehand, the
    // approximation gets worse the closer p1 is to one of them.)
